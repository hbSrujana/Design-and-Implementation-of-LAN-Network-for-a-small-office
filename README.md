# 🌐 Design and Implementation of LAN Network for a Small Office

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of a LAN network for a small home office** environment using **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.1**.  
The aim was to create a structured, scalable, and efficient network that supports multiple departments, wireless access, VLAN configuration, DHCP, and inter-department communication.

The project was completed as part of my **Summer Internship-I.
